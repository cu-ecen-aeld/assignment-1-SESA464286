# 
# Write a shell script finder-app/writer.sh as described below
#
# - Accepts the following arguments: the first argument is a full path to a file (including filename) on the
#    filesystem, referred to below as writefile; the second argument is a text string which will be written
#    within this file, referred to below as writestr
# - Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the arguments above were not specified
# - Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content writestr, overwriting any existing file and
#    creating the path if it doesnâ€™t exist. Exits with value 1 and error print statement if the file could not be created.
# Example:
#       writer.sh /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt ios
#
# Creates file:
#    /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt
#
#            With content:
#            ios
